# ESP32-C6 CO₂ Monitor

This project implements an ESPHome configuration for an ESP32-C6-based multisensor device focused on monitoring indoor air quality. It collects data from CO₂, temperature, humidity, pressure, luminosity, and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors. A key goal of the design is to reduce heat generation to ensure accurate temperature readings.
